As you can see i have forked the repo from someone and have edited this according to the code for better functionality - 

/************* Original ReadMe(with minor modifications ;-)) ***********************/
I created this project mainly because I take photos extensively for my
photolog and like them to be saved with the timestamp as the filename so that
they can be accessed quickly later.

This script will rename any type of specified file( e.g .jpeg,.bmp etc) in a specified directory as the date
and time of their creation.It will do the same upto any number of levels in that directory.

I have made this generic for all file types. It will work nicely for any file type
Just enter the file type as the last command line argument. Case is important.

How To :

Just type the following command in the terminal :

python phototime.py /path/to/your/photo/folder Location_Name File_extension_without_preceding_dot
