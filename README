I created this project mainly because I take photos extensively for my
photolog and like them to be saved with the timestamp as the filename so that
they can be accessed quickly later.

This script will rename all the jpeg files in a specified directory as the date
and time of their creation.What's more, it will do the same for directories nested upto
one level in that directory. As of now there is no support for recursion but 
I hope to add it soon, if enough number of people think it would be useful
enough.

I have made this generic for all file types. It will work nicely for any file type
Just enter the file type as the last command line argument. Case is important ( As of now ;) )

How To :

Just type the following command in the terminal :

python phototime.py /path/to/your/photo/folder File_extension_without_preceding_dot

TODO :

-Add recursion
-Make the code fool-proof to folder names with whitespaces in them
-Make the code independent of case
-Add support for extension using * instead of specifying extension
