I created this project mainly because I take photos extensively for my
photolog and like them to be saved with the timestamp as the filename so that
they can be accessed quickly later.

This script will rename all the jpeg files a specified directory as the date
and time of their creation. As of there is no support for recursion but 
I hope to add it soon, if enough number of people think it would be useful
enough.

//This is specially for JPG files, but you can easily rename it in the code and
//use it equally well for any other file type.
Edit : I have made this generic for all file types. It will work nicely for any file type
Just enter the file type as the last command line argument. Case is important ( As of now ;) )

How To :

Just type the following command in the terminal :

python phototime.py /path/to/your/photo/folder File_extension_without_preceding_dot
